# H-index Booster

### Calculate H-index
From Wikipedia:
> The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times. The 
index is designed to improve upon simpler measures such as the total number of citations or publications.

### Maximize H-index Via Collaboration
To maximize H-index of author, we purpose a collabration project initially involving **2N** person, that garuntee a **N** H-index of every single initial 
collabrator.

### How To
Every collabrator will publish one paper under the name of all current collabrators sequencially, citing all previously published papers in the sequence. 
For **2N** initial collaborators, this will generate **N** papers with at least **N** citations, which means that every intial collabrator will 
gain an H-index of **N**. New comers can join the sequence natually at its end, also benefiting from the H-index boost.
